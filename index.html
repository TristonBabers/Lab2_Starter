        <h2> Unfinished Business: Vince why?</h2>
        <p>
            Why did the show only have 5 season?<br>
            It easily could have had 6 seasons minimum, or maybe at least an extra movie like
            <em>El Camino</em>, or at least extra content about what Saul was doing during
            <i> Breaking Bad</i>. But no, 5 seasons, no movie, no follow up. I am devastated.
            <strong>Bravo Vince!</strong>
